# Ramblings.ai

**Ramblings.ai** is a social diary powered by AI. Share your random thoughts—our system automatically summarizes them to keep things civil. Whether you want a private space for personal reflections or a public platform for feedback, Ramblings.ai helps you keep track of ideas without the usual noise.

## How It Works

- **Speak or Type**: Record a ramble by talking or typing.  
- **AI Summaries**: Our AI filters and summarizes your text into a concise, respectful version.  
- **Social & Private**: Keep rambles private for free, or spend credits to make them public.  
- **Engagement**: Others can upvote/downvote and comment, all passed through the AI filter.  
- **Soapbox**: Step up to the spotlight, with time added or removed based on votes.

## Key Features

- **No Ads**: We use a credit-based system instead of ads.  
- **Credit System**: Post publicly by spending credits; earn credits through positive community feedback.  
- **View Original Text**: (If the poster allows) spend a few credits to see the unfiltered ramble.  
- **Strict Filtering**: Offensive or aggressive content is either rewritten or rejected.

## Status

Ramblings.ai is a private project under active development. We’re big fans of open source and plan to release related open-source projects later on. For now, our core app remains closed while we refine and build it out.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue exploring new ways to share and summarize your thoughts!
